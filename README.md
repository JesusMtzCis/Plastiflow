# Plastiflow
A DIY PET shredder and filament maker developed by Mecathronics Engineer Students from TecNM Campus Colima.

It consist of two phases:

1.-Shredder: The upper part consist of 11 shaves, 12 spacers and its respectives cleaner which are confined in a metal box. The shredding is done by a 12v DC motor which has a torque increaser.
2.-Melting: The shredded plastic is deposited in a hopper and, when the heating tube is hot enough, the PET is pushed by an endless screw and it is ejected melted with a 1.75mm diameter.

The project also counts with a panel control where is located the motherboard which is controlled by a STM32 microcontroller, exactly the Nucleo board F411RE.
